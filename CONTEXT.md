# eudi-dev

A developer toolkit for the EUDI and OpenID4VC ecosystem. This glossary covers the terms this project uses differently or more narrowly than the specifications it implements.

## Language

### Credentials

**Credential**:
A signed set of claims about a person. The wallet holds it and presents it to a verifier. The word always means the concrete artifact. For its kind, say credential type.
_Avoid_: Attestation (see below), document, VC

**Credential type**:
The kind of a credential, identified by its `vct` (SD-JWT VC) or `doctype` (mdoc). A wallet holds many credentials of one type.
_Avoid_: Credential configuration, schema

**Extending type**:
A credential type that contains everything another type defines and adds more. For example, the German PID (`urn:eudi:pid:de:1`) extends the country-independent EUDI PID (`urn:eudi:pid:1`). A credential of an extending type answers a request for the extended type. The reverse does not hold. Say **extending** and **extended type**. The relation describes content only. It does not say who may issue the credential.
_Avoid_: Subtype, derived type, inherited credential, trust relationship

**Attestation**:
Always qualify this word. It has three unrelated meanings: a **client attestation** (the wallet proving itself to an issuer), a **verifier attestation** (a verifier proving itself to the wallet), and an **issued attestation** (the wallet's record of an issued credential type. Its trusted lists name these types). EUDI documents also use "attestation" as a synonym for credential.

**Template**:
A named, reusable set of claims and issuance settings. The wallet issues credentials from it. A template is not a credential and not a credential type.
_Avoid_: Preset, profile

**PID**:
Person Identification Data, the EUDI-defined identity credential. There is the country-independent **EUDI PID** of the ARF rulebook and there are national types that extend it, such as the **German PID**. Say which one you mean when it matters. "PID" alone means the credential. Do not use it for a process id in code that also handles credentials.
_Avoid_: PID as process id (write `processID`)

### Roles

**Wallet**:
The holder. Depending on context this is the stored state, the running server, or the CLI that operates on either. Qualify it as **wallet state**, **wallet server**, or **wallet CLI** when the difference matters.

**Issuer**:
The party that signs and issues a credential. This toolkit is also an issuer. Say **external issuer** for any other issuer and **demo issuer** for the one this toolkit runs.

**Verifier**:
The party that requests and checks a presentation. Say **demo verifier** for the one this toolkit runs. It is different from validation, where this tool checks a credential offline for the user.
_Avoid_: RP

**Relying party**:
A verifier or issuer registered with a registrar (TS05). In a presentation flow, say verifier.
_Avoid_: RP, WRP (in prose)

**Registrar**:
Keeps the register of relying parties for a member state (ARF Topic 27) and issues their access and registration certificates. The wallet includes one.

**Intended use**:
A registered purpose of a relying party. It lists which credentials and claims the relying party may request for it. A verifier's registration certificate covers one intended use.

**Access certificate**:
Identifies a relying party (ETSI TS 119 411-8). A verifier signs its request objects with the certificate's key. An issuer signs its metadata with that key.

**Registration certificate**:
A signed JWT from the registrar (ETSI TS 119 475). A verifier's certificate lists one intended use, and the verifier sends it in `verifier_info`. An issuer's certificate lists the attestation types of its service, and the issuer publishes it in `issuer_info`.

**Attestation catalogue**:
A list of attestation types (EC TS11 catalogue of attestations). Each entry has a credential category and links a schema for each format, a rulebook and a trusted list, by default the list of its category. Every predefined credential template has an entry.

**Relying party access CA**:
Signs the access certificates from the wallet's registrar, including those of the demo issuer and the demo verifier. It is a root of its own, separate from the wallet CA. The wallet's `access-ca` list names it.

**Registrar CA**:
Signs the registrar's signing certificate, which signs registration certificates and their status list. It is a root of its own. The wallet's `registrar` list names it.

**Instance**:
A running wallet server registered on this machine. The CLI uses the registration to find and control it. Several instances can serve the same wallet state.

### Requests and flows

**Authorization request**:
A verifier's request for a presentation. Its parameters may arrive in a URI or inside a request object.

**Request object**:
The signed JWT (a JAR) that carries the parameters of an authorization request. A request may also come without a request object.
_Avoid_: JAR (in prose), signed request

**Consent request**:
A pending decision the user makes before the wallet sends a presentation. A verifier's authorization request creates it. It exists only inside this wallet.

**Owner**:
The browser a flow belongs to. The wallet identifies it by the `eudi_session` cookie, or a client sets it in the `X-Eudi-Owner` header. A consent request, an error report and an issuer sign-in prompt each have an owner. The term is unrelated to the credential holder and to the OAuth resource owner. A flow started without an owner is **unowned**. Every caller can see and answer it.
_Avoid_: session, page, acting owner

**Presentation**:
What the wallet sends a verifier in answer to an authorization request. The word means both the act and the artifact. Say **VP token** for the artifact when the difference matters.

**Offer**:
An issuer's invitation to collect a credential. Accepting one starts an issuance.
_Avoid_: Invitation, issuance request

**Deferred issuance**:
An issuance the issuer accepted but did not complete immediately. The wallet collects the credential later. The stored field is `pending`.
_Avoid_: Pending issuance

**Renewal**:
Replacing a credential with a fresh copy from its issuer before it expires, keeping the same credential id. It differs from a **refresh token** (the OAuth grant a renewal may use) and from **certificate refresh** (re-issuing the wallet's own signing leaf certificate). The CLI verb is `refresh`.
_Avoid_: Refresh (for the credential operation)

### Trust and status

**Trusted list**:
A signed list that names providers and their certificates. ETSI TS 119 602 calls it a **list of trusted entities** (LoTE). The names mean the same thing. A wallet or verifier checks that a certificate chains to a certificate on the list for its kind. This wallet publishes one list per credential category ([ADR-0022](docs/adr/0022-one-trusted-list-per-credential-category.md)) and the lists `wallet-provider`, `access-ca` and `registrar`. It takes every trust anchor from trusted lists ([ADR-0023](docs/adr/0023-trust-anchors-come-from-trusted-lists.md)). A trusted list operator signs a list.
_Avoid_: Trust list, trust profile

**List of trusted lists**:
A trusted list that points to other trusted lists, each with the certificate of its signer (ETSI TS 119 602 §6.3.13). The wallet publishes one that points to its own lists and to the added external lists. It follows the pointers of an external list of trusted lists one level deep.

**Credential category**:
The kind of attestation: `pid`, `qeaa`, `pub-eaa` or `eaa` (ARF ISSU_07 to ISSU_10). Each category has its own signing key, provider CA and trusted list. A credential gets its category from `--category`, its template or its catalogue entry. A credential without one is an EAA. The category `unlisted` keeps a credential off every list.
_Avoid_: Trust profile

**Provider role**:
A signer of this wallet with its own key and provider CA under the wallet CA. The roles are the four credential categories, `wallet` (the wallet provider, whose list is `wallet-provider`), `unlisted` (unlisted credentials) and `tl-<8 hex>` (a custom trusted list).
_Avoid_: Trust profile (for the role)

**Status list**:
The published bitstring a verifier fetches to check whether a credential is still valid. The wallet manages the entries on its own list and reads the lists of other issuers.

**Revocation**:
Marking a credential invalid on a status list. Revocation informs verifiers. The wallet can still present a revoked credential.

### Modes

**Validation mode**:
Controls whether normative findings in incoming messages are warnings and the flow continues (`debug`), or errors that stop the flow (`strict`). Both modes collect the same findings. **HAIP enforcement** (`--haip`) adds profile checks. Most findings follow the validation mode. Advisory findings are always warnings.

**Demo profile**:
The hardened configuration for hosting a wallet publicly. A deployment setting, unrelated to validation mode and to **HAIP** (a specification profile). Always qualify "profile".
_Avoid_: Demo mode, public mode

### State

**Storage backend**:
Where the wallet state is stored: `file` (the default, in the wallet directory), `memory` (in the process) or `postgres` (in a shared database). Set it with `--storage` or `EUDI_DEV_STORAGE`. Every backend stores the keys, certificates, assets and templates under the same names.
_Avoid_: Database (for the layer as a whole), persistence provider

**Seed**:
A string the wallet derives its generated keys from. With a seed, a wallet that stores nothing has the same keys on every start. It is unrelated to the baseline credentials of the demo profile.
_Avoid_: Seed (for the demo profile's starting credentials, say baseline)

**Wallet directory**:
The path that identifies a wallet. On the file backend the files are stored there. On every backend the CLI uses it to find the server for that wallet.

### Diagnostics

**Activity log**:
The persisted, user-facing record of what the wallet did, shown in the UI and printed by the CLI.

**Protocol log entry**:
An activity log entry that also contains the request or response exactly as sent or received.
