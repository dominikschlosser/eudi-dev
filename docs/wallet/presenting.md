# Presenting from the wallet

The wallet answers an OID4VP presentation request from the CLI (`wallet accept`), from a scanned QR (`wallet scan`), or at its own `/authorize` URL. `wallet accept` also handles credential offers (see [issuing into the wallet](issuing.md)).

## `wallet accept <uri>`

Detects the URI type and dispatches to the matching flow:

- `openid4vp://`, `haip-vp://`, `eudi-openid4vp://`: OID4VP presentation (evaluates DCQL, shows the consent UI, submits the VP token)
  - Supports `response_type=vp_token id_token` (SIOPv2 + OID4VP combined flow). Generates a self-issued ID token alongside the VP token
  - Supports `response_type=id_token` (SIOPv2 only). Generates a self-issued ID token without VP token
- `openid-credential-offer://`, `haip-vci://`, `eu-eaa-offer://`: OID4VCI credential issuance (fetches the credential from the issuer)

EUDI issuance uses `eu-eaa-offer://` under [ETSI TS 119 472-3 V1.1.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/11947203/01.01.01_60/ts_11947203v010101p.pdf), requirement GEN-REQ-4.1-06. All three offer schemes accept `credential_offer` and `credential_offer_uri` parameters.

In interactive mode (the default), OID4VP requests start a temporary consent UI server and open it in the browser. With `--auto-accept`, the wallet submits one credential per credential query (the most recently issued match), or all matching ones when the query sets `multiple: true`.

When a verifier responds to a presentation with a `redirect_uri`, the wallet prints the URL and opens it in a browser. A scripted run, or a host without a desktop, only prints it. `--no-open` disables opening.

`debug` mode matches DCQL queries loosely to help troubleshoot verifier queries. A credential that matches the requested format and metadata and at least one requested claim counts as a match with a warning, even when other required claim paths are missing. `strict` mode requires every claim path.

The wallet presents a `jwt_vc_json` credential without a Verifiable Presentation, so it can't prove holder binding. Such a credential answers only a query with `require_cryptographic_holder_binding: false` (OpenID4VP 1.0 Appendix B.1).

```bash
eudi wallet accept 'openid4vp://authorize?...' --auto-accept
eudi wallet accept 'eu-eaa-offer://?credential_offer_uri=...'
eudi wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...'
eudi wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...' --tx-code 123456
```

Pre-authorized code offers work directly with `wallet accept`. Authorization code offers require a running `wallet serve` instance. The client ID defaults to the wallet origin and the redirect URI to its `/callback` endpoint. Override them with `--vci-client-id` and `--vci-redirect-uri`. The wallet uses PAR and DPoP when advertised by the issuer.

For sign-in, `wallet accept` prints the authorization URL. It opens the URL only when no wallet page is already handling the flow, because the request can be used once (RFC 9126 §4). After the issuer redirects back, the wallet exchanges the code. The CLI waits for the credential or an error. A remote wallet follows the same process. See [sign-in during issuance](issuing.md#sign-in-during-issuance).

Strict mode verifies HTTPS certificates. Debug mode skips verification by default. For local flows, `--tls-verify=true|false` overrides either default and `--tls-ca dev-ca.pem` adds trusted CA certificates. See [HTTPS certificate verification](serve.md#https-certificate-verification).

When `accept` or `scan` forwards a flow to a running wallet, that wallet uses its own settings for every step of the flow. Passing `--mode`, `--haip`, `--arf`, `--key-attestation-level`, the CA flags, `--trusted-list`, TLS or proxy flags in this case returns an error. Set them on `wallet serve`, change them in its Conformance panel, or put CAs and lists on its trusted lists with [`wallet trust`](serve.md#trusted-lists).

## `wallet scan`

Scans a QR code from an image file or screen capture and detects the content:

- `openid4vp://`, `haip-vp://`, `eudi-openid4vp://`: delegates to `accept` (OID4VP presentation)
- `openid-credential-offer://`, `haip-vci://`, `eu-eaa-offer://`: delegates to `accept` (OID4VCI issuance)
- SD-JWT / mdoc raw credential: delegates to `import`

```bash
eudi wallet scan qr-image.png
eudi wallet scan --screen              # macOS interactive screen capture
eudi wallet scan --screen --auto-accept # auto-approve if it's a presentation
```

`wallet scan` reads the QR code, then runs the same flow as `wallet accept`. If a remote target is configured or a wallet is running, it sends the request to that wallet and opens its consent UI. Otherwise it handles the request locally.

The wallet handling the flow fetches the offer and prompts for a transaction code when one is required. For a local flow, the CLI prompts when stdin is a terminal and `--tx-code` was not given. See [ADR-0012](../adr/0012-every-entry-point-runs-the-same-flow.md).

`wallet scan` uses the persistent `wallet --mode` setting and accepts the same `--auto-accept`, `--tx-code`, `--haip`, `--arf`, `--relying-party-ca`, `--trusted-list-ca` and `--trusted-list` flags as `accept`.

## Invoking the wallet by URL

Both wallet flows also run at the wallet's own URL, wherever a verifier or issuer would use a custom-scheme link. Custom schemes are registered on macOS only.

| Custom scheme | Wallet URL |
|---------------|------------|
| `openid4vp://?<params>` or `openid4vp://authorize?<params>` | `http://localhost:8085/authorize?<params>` |
| `openid-credential-offer://?<params>`, `haip-vci://?<params>` or `eu-eaa-offer://?<params>` | `http://localhost:8085/credential-offer?<params>` |

To convert a link, replace everything before the `?` with the wallet endpoint URL and keep the query string unchanged.

In a custom-scheme URI the part between `://` and `?` has no meaning, so `openid4vp://?...` and `openid4vp://authorize?...` are the same request.

```bash
# Presentation request: standard OID4VP authorization request parameters
curl 'http://localhost:8085/authorize?client_id=...&request_uri=...'

# Credential offer by reference
curl 'http://localhost:8085/credential-offer?credential_offer_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fissuer.example%2Foffer%2F123'

# Credential offer by value (url-encoded offer JSON), with a transaction code
curl 'http://localhost:8085/credential-offer?credential_offer=%7B...%7D&tx_code=1234'
```

`/credential-offer` accepts `credential_offer` or `credential_offer_uri`, plus an optional `tx_code` for the pre-authorized code flow.

Browser navigations are GET requests that accept HTML, such as clicked links. After a presentation, the browser goes to the verifier's `redirect_uri`, or to the wallet UI if none was returned. The same applies after a refusal (a denied request or no matching credential), because the verifier can return a `redirect_uri` for an error response too (OpenID4VP 1.0 §8.2). After an offer import, the browser goes to the wallet UI.

Other callers, including curl and test harnesses, receive the same JSON responses as `POST /api/presentations` and `POST /api/offers`. `keycloak-extension-oid4vp` can set `walletScheme` to the wallet's `/authorize` URL.

In interactive mode (no `--auto-accept`) the two caller types also behave differently before consent. A browser navigation redirects to the wallet UI for consent and then to the verifier's `redirect_uri`. An API call blocks until the request is approved or denied, in the UI or via `POST /api/requests/{id}/approve` or `/deny`. Both responses carry the verifier's `redirect_uri` when it returned one.

## HAIP 1.0 Enforcement

`--haip` on `wallet serve` or `wallet accept` checks incoming requests and offers against [HAIP 1.0 Final](https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-1_0-final.html). `--demo` turns it on by default (see [hosting a public demo](../public-demo.md)).

`--haip` adds the profile checks below. Strict mode rejects violations. Debug mode reports them and continues where possible. Advisory findings remain warnings in either mode.

For **presentations** (OID4VP `direct_post.jwt` and Browser API `dc_api.jwt`) the wallet checks every request against all of:

- `response_type` must be `vp_token` (§5)
- `response_mode` must be `direct_post.jwt` (§5.1) or `dc_api.jwt` (§5.2)
- A signed request must use the `x509_hash:` Client Identifier Prefix (§5), and its Request Object signature must verify against a certificate whose SHA-256 is the prefix value
- The certificate signing the request must not be self-signed, and the trust anchor must not be included in the `x5c` header (§5)
- A request sent by redirect must carry a signed request object (JAR) delivered through `request_uri` (§5.1). An unsigned request is accepted only over the Digital Credentials API, where §5.2 requires wallet support for it
- The query must use DCQL (§5), and every credential it asks for must be `mso_mdoc` (§5.3.1) or `dc+sd-jwt` (§5.3.2)
- The Verifier's client metadata must list both `A128GCM` and `A256GCM` in `encrypted_response_enc_values_supported` (§5)
- A signed Digital Credentials API request must list the caller origin in `expected_origins` (OpenID4VP Appendix A.2, which §5.2 incorporates)
- The request object signing algorithm must be `ES256`

In `--mode strict` a non-compliant request is refused with HTTP 400. `POST /api/presentations` then returns `{"error": "<code>", "error_description": "<failed checks>"}`, with an OpenID4VP 1.0 §8.5 error code such as `invalid_request`. In `--mode debug` the same findings are logged as warnings and the flow continues.

For **issuance**, HAIP §6.1.1 checks every received credential. That covers every issuance flow and every copy of a batch. An SD-JWT VC must include its issuer signing certificate and chain in `x5c`, without the trust anchor. The signing certificate must not be self-signed.

The credential issuer must use HTTPS, with a loopback exception. Authorization code flows also require the authorization server to support that grant and offer PAR when using the authorization endpoint.

PKCE and DPoP metadata is checked when present. A server advertising PKCE without `S256`, or DPoP without `ES256`, violates the profile. Omitted metadata is accepted because the referenced OAuth specifications make these fields optional and FAPI 2.0 constrains server behavior. Client authentication metadata is not checked.

For pre-authorized offers, only the HTTPS transport rule applies to this part of validation. HAIP §4 requires support for authorization code issuance but scopes PAR to use of the authorization endpoint.

§5 of the profile allows only `x509_hash` for signed requests. The wallet therefore refuses `x509_san_dns`, although OpenID4VP defines it.

An unsigned request arrives over the Digital Credentials API without a Request Object. Appendix A.2 of OpenID4VP says such a request carries no `client_id`, and a wallet ignores one that is present. The origin reported by the platform identifies the caller.

§7 requires at least ES256. The wallet advertises ES256 in `request_object_signing_alg_values_supported`.

As a client the wallet always follows the profile (PAR, PKCE S256, DPoP, wallet attestation when advertised, ES256 proofs, key attestation). `--haip` only changes how it validates issuers and verifiers.

```bash
eudi wallet serve --haip --auto-accept --pid
eudi wallet accept --haip 'openid4vp://authorize?...'
```

Every request to a given wallet uses the same validation mode, HAIP, ARF and encrypted-request settings.

## ARF checks

*(new in 3.0.0)*

`--arf` on `wallet serve`, `wallet accept` or `wallet scan` checks the relying party's access and registration certificates in a presentation request against the ARF. It checks issuers too (see [issuing](issuing.md#arf-checks)). `--demo` turns it on by default. The Conformance panel and `PUT /api/config/conformance` (`arf`) switch it at runtime.

The wallet checks that:

- the request is signed with an access certificate in `x5c` (RPA_03)
- the access certificate chains to a trusted access certificate authority (RPA_04)
- the request carries exactly one registration certificate in `verifier_info` (RPRC_19)
- the registration certificate is signed by a trusted registrar (RPRC_02a), names the relying party of the access certificate (RPRC_17a), has a valid signature and `typ`, contains all claims required by ETSI TS 119 475 and is not expired (RPRC_17)
- the registrar has not revoked the registration certificate (RPRC_17). Its status list must be readable and chain to a trusted registrar (RPACANot_03b)
- the request asks only for credentials and claims registered in that certificate (RPRC_21)

The ARF lets the Wallet Provider decide whether to refuse (RPA_06a). In `--mode debug` the wallet logs the findings as warnings and goes on. `POST /api/presentations` returns them in `findings`. This works for requests by URL, over the Digital Credentials API and during [interactive authorization](issuing.md#interactive-authorization). Strict mode refuses.

How strict mode refuses depends on the verifier. When only ARF findings remain and the request is signed with a trusted access certificate, the wallet sends the verifier an `access_denied` error response (OpenID4VP 1.0 §8.5, RFC 6749 §4.1.2.1). Its `error_description` is "The request does not meet the ARF registration rules: " followed by the findings, for example `ARF RPRC_19: ...`. `POST /api/presentations` answers with status `refused` and the same description. `wallet accept` and `wallet scan` send the same response. Over the Digital Credentials API, the error is in the API result (OpenID4VP 1.0 Appendix A). Any other strict refusal stays in the wallet. The caller gets HTTP 400 as described under [HAIP 1.0 Enforcement](#haip-10-enforcement).

The [registrar API walkthrough](registrar-api.md) shows both outcomes with real requests.

Consent shows purposes and privacy policies only from registration certificates that belong to the access certificate of the signed request. An unsigned request shows none.

The wallet takes its trust anchors from [trusted lists](serve.md#trusted-lists) only. An access certificate must chain to a CA on an access certificate provider list (`access-ca`, ETSI TS 119 602 V1.1.1 Annex F). The wallet's own list names the relying party access CA of its [registrar](registrar.md). The demo issuer and the demo verifier get their access certificates from that CA too. A registration certificate and its status list must chain to a CA on a registration certificate provider list (`registrar`, Annex G). The wallet's own list names the registrar CA. The relying party access CA signs any visitor's CSR, so it is not on the `registrar` list.

For the CAs of another ecosystem, such as a member state's sandbox, use `wallet trust add-ca --list access-ca` and `--list registrar`, or `--relying-party-ca`, which puts the CAs on both lists. An external list on the list of trusted lists works too. See [ADR 0023](../adr/0023-trust-anchors-come-from-trusted-lists.md).
