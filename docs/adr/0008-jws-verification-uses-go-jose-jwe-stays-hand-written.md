# JWS verification uses go-jose, JWE uses local code

All JWS verification uses `jws.Verify`, a wrapper around go-jose. Each caller passes the allowed algorithms when parsing, so the token cannot choose them. This gives `sdjwt`, `statuslist`, `wallet` and `demorp` the same signature checks.

## go-jose and the JWE

When go-jose encrypts, it derives the ECDH-ES key with empty `apu` and `apv` (`DeriveECDHES(algID, []byte{}, []byte{}, ...)` in its key generator). It has no option to set them. ISO 18013-7 Annex B requires the mdoc generated nonce in `apu` and the request nonce in `apv`. This wallet sends both for mdoc presentations. With go-jose, the header would carry the nonces but the key would come from empty values. The verifier could not decrypt any of these presentations.

go-jose reads `apu` and `apv` correctly when decrypting. Using the library only for decryption would mean two Concat KDF implementations to maintain. Both directions use the same local code.

The proxy also decrypts captured JWEs using content encryption keys from a key log, without the private key.

## Consequences

Before moving JWE to a library, check that it can set `apu` and `apv` when encrypting. The mdoc presentation tests cover this. The JWE tests alone do not.

Comments in the JWE code explain the key derivation and the AES-CBC-HS256 path, including PKCS#7 padding. A library that supports the required nonce handling could replace this code.
